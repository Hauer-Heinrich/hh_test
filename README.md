# Github Actions for TYPO3 Extensions

## How to automatically create/publish a new Release on TYPO3 TER
1. Copy .github folder to your own Repository / Project
2. Edit composer.json and ext_emconf.php and change the Version Number
3. Then execute (replace the version): `VERSION="X.X.X" && git commit -am "New Version $VERSION" && git tag "$VERSION" && git push && git push --tags`
4. Check if the Github Action has been successfully executed, go to your Repository and click on the "Actions" Tab (usually something like https://github.com/username/repositoryname/actions)

The next time you want to push a new Release, then use step 3. and 4.
